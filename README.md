## 🗄️ Database Architecture & Security

### 🔒 PDO — 100% SQL Injection Protection

All database queries use **PHP Data Objects (PDO)** with **native prepared statements** (`PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES => false`). This ensures queries and data are sent separately to MySQL, making SQL injection **structurally impossible**.

```php
// config/database.php — Connection configuration
$options = [
    PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE            => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,
    PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_ASSOC,
    PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES   => false, // ❌ No emulation — real native prepares
];
```

### 🔑 BCrypt Password Hashing

Passwords are hashed using `password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT)` and verified with `password_verify()`, ensuring industry-standard cryptographic storage.

### 📐 Third Normal Form (3NF) Relational Model

| Table            | Purpose                                    | Key Relationships                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `admins`         | Admin credentials                          | —                                          |
| `students`       | Self-registered student accounts           | —                                          |
| `members`        | Library member records (FK bridge)         | Referenced by `issued_books`               |
| `categories`     | Book categories (Fiction, Science, etc.)   | One-to-Many → `books`                      |
| `books`          | Book inventory with quantity tracking      | FK → `categories`                          |
| `departments`    | University department list                 | Used for registration datalist             |
| `issued_books`   | **Junction table** (Many-to-Many)          | FK → `books`, FK → `members`              |

### ⚙️ Database Configuration

| Parameter | Value                    |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| **Host**  | `localhost`              |
| **Port**  | `3307`                   |
| **Name**  | `library_db`             |
| **Charset** | `utf8mb4`              |
| **User**  | `root` (default XAMPP)   |

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (PHP 8.x + MySQL 8.x)
- Git
- A modern web browser

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gstu-library-dims.git
cd gstu-library-dims
```

Move the project folder to `C:\xampp\htdocs\` (Windows) or `/opt/lampp/htdocs/` (Linux).

### Step 2 — Configure MySQL Port (3307)

XAMPP's default MySQL port is `3306`. This project uses **port 3307**. To avoid conflicts:

1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**.
2. Click **Config** → **my.ini** next to MySQL.
3. Find the line `port=3306` and change it to:
   ```ini
   port=3307
   ```
4. Restart MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.

> **Note:** The connection is already configured in `config/database.php`:
> ```php
> define('DB_PORT', '3307');
> ```

### Step 3 — Import the Database

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
2. Click **New** → create a database named `library_db` with collation `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.
3. Click the **Import** tab.
4. Choose the `database.sql` file from the project root and click **Go**.

The script will create all tables (`admins`, `students`, `members`, `categories`, `books`, `departments`, `issued_books`) and seed sample data.

### Step 4 — Launch the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/University library system/
```

### 🔑 Default Credentials

| Role    | Identifier   | Password   |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Admin   | `admin`      | `admin123` |
| Student | *(register)* | *(set during registration)* |
